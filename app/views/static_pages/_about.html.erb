cristheinz is <strong><a href="http://pt.linkedin.com/in/christianodomingues">Christiano Domingues</a></strong> another geek deeply inspired by Tony Stark, actually in love with ruby and rails but still in a serious java relationship.<br/> As a programmer struggles to create applications to be simple and pratical, reason why do not appreciate all the noise from the web, so tries to let things clean and responsive. As a believer is a <strong>God</strong> fearing man who trusts in His mercy and benevolence.<br/> cristheinz wasn't born specially for fun but mainly to keep me on the track of learning things.
